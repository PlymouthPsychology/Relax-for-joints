    >Our breathing is closely linked to our emotions. 

    > When we're anxious we breathe quickly. When frightened, we sometimes hold our breath. When we're calm, safe, and relaxed we breathe slowly and deeply. 

    Breathing is also one of the few bodily functions that can be both automatic, or voluntary. It can happen without us paying attention, but we can also control and slow it down our breath as we choose.

    **Slowing our breath and breathing deeply are strong signals to our brain that we are safe, and that all is well.**
