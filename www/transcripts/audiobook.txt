Joint replacement changes lives, but it is not a 'quick fix'. Most patients experience some pain and discomfort. 

There are lots of things you can do to speed your recovery. 

> Scientists' understanding of pain has changed in the last 20 years. Pain is more complicated than we first thought: Our feelings and emotions play a big role in how much pain we feel. 

The link between our emotions and pain is not just 'in our heads' or imaginary: it has a big impact on our bodies too. 

When the brain feels threatened it sends messages to the spinal cord and to nerves throughout our body. These messages tell the body to magnify our sensations, and sometimes make even gentle sensations painful.

This is what everyone having surgery needs to know:  

1. We only feel pain when our brain thinks our body is under threat. When we're upset or anxious we feel more pain.
2. Surgery can make us more sensitive to threats. Even normal sensations can become painful.
3. Pain after joint surgery, especially when moving, is normal. It's not a sign that anything is wrong, but...


Thankfully, we can reduce pain by using relaxation and positive suggestions.
