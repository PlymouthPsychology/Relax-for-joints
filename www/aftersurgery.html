    Patients differ a great deal in how painful they find the surgery, but almost everyone finds movement after surgery painful.

    Pain is normally scored on a scale between 0 and 10. Zero means "no pain", and ten means the "worst possible pain".

    - When resting, most patients experience mild or moderate pain: about 3 to 5 out of 10).

    - Almost all patients find moving more painful than resting. In the days after surgery, <!-- half of  -->the majority of patients rate their pain when moving as 7 or higher.

    - About 1 in every 10 patients will have severe pain - 7 out of 10 or higher - both at rest and when moving<!--  in the days after surgery -->.

      Why pain is important?

    Nobody wants to be in pain at all. But after joint surgery it's even more important to manage your pain. This will allow you to get back on your feet, and strengthen the joint.

    > It may seem strange, but it's important to keep moving even if it hurts.

    After surgery, our brains feel the body is under threat. Even small signals from our bodies can become magnified, and hurt more than they usually would.

    Moving and exercising is key to recovery. Some pain is to be expected, and doesn't mean you are damaging the joint.

    > After surgery, our brains become very sensitive to signals of threat. 

    > Pain is normal, and not a sign that something is wrong. But we can do things to be more comfortable.

    We find that patients do best when they keep moving, and manage their pain by:

    - Taking painkillers effectively
    - Relaxing, and
    - Using positive imagery and suggestion
