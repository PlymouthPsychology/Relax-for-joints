        Pain can seem simple: it's the sensation we feel when we injure ourselves.

        But pain is ***not*** this simple. To experience pain, we need more than just signals from the body. We also need to interpret these signals as *dangerous*. 

        This is why relaxing can help reduce pain: when we relax we find bodily sensations less threatening, and less painful.

        Changing expectations and experience
    </div>

    <div class="item-body">
      <marked> 

        There are many ways to change our expectations, and therefore our experience of pain.  

        One common technique is to think of an outcome we would like (for example, for our pain to slowly subside), and focus our attention on this. 

        Imagining things doesn't always make them come true â€” if it did we would all be lottery winners! But our brains and bodies are tightly connected and have a strong influence on each other. Many scientific studies have shown that pain and nausea can be reduced by a substantial amount in this way. 

        > We are able to change how we experience pain, sensations from our body, and how we move, by listening and responding to positive suggestions.

        Sometimes, listening to a recording can help visualise the positive outcome, and focus our attention. In this app we provide recordings of positive suggestions.

        We have worked with many patients to make sure the suggestions are just right for patients after joint surgery. The recordings are designed to:

        - Reduce pain
        - Increase comfort in the joint
        - Reduce nausea after surgery (if needed)

        In the recording below, we ask you to listen and respond to some suggestions about how your body feels. The speaker suggests that your body feels heavy and warm. 

        Listen to the suggestions and notice how they make you feel.  

        Most people are able to respond to suggestions like this. If you feel yourself responding, it's likely this type of suggestion can help you as you recover from surgery.
